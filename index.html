             <p>Ellis is a word nerd and social media junkie studying Telecommunications and English at the University of Florida. She has emphasized her studies in social media and digital adaptation. While originally from Mississippi, her education and organizational involvement have taken her all over the world. Aside from travel, her free time is almost wholly taken up by books, either by reading or editing.</p>
                <p>Ms. Starkey currently lives, works, and studies in Gainesville, Florida, but her involvment with organizations around the world is facilitated by her focus on online communications and social media. These tools have allowed her to jumpstart her publishing career by working with texts and their authors from hundreds of miles away.
                </p>
                <p>The University of Florida Gator Band has had a particular impact on Ms. Starkey. Her four years with the group have been the climax of over a decade of musical cooperation and achievement.
